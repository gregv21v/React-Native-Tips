## Common Errors Messages

Sometimes when you compile your react code it will give you an error like this:

```
TypeError: Failed to construct 'Image': Please use the 'new' operator, this DOM object constructor cannot be called as a function.
```

This likely means that you forget to include an import. In the above case, the import you forgot would be the Image component.
